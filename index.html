            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">Our thinnest, lightest notebook, completely transformed by the Apple M1
                chip. CPU speeds up to 3.5x faster. GPU speeds up to 5x faster. Our most advanced Neural Engine for up
                to 9x faster machine learning. The longest battery life ever in a MacBook Air. And a silent, fanless
                design.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">
                Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released
                earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and
                scissor-switch keyboard.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t
                consider the
                MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build
                quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air
                should be fine for everyone else.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14.
                It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel.
                But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work
                driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance
                with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of
                the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many
                customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new
                gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc"><b>THE BEST LAPTOP IN 2021 FOR BIG-SCREEN FANS</b>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how
                light the LG Gram 17 is. It has
                a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you
                feel like you’re not holding anything.
                But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you
                can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans,
                and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking
                for a heavier-duty workstation
                that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily
                office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly
                impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels
                premium.The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">HP Envy x360 13 (2020) is a Windows 10 Home laptop with a 13.30-inch
                display that has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. It is powered by a Ryzen 7 Octa Core processor. The
                HP Envy x360 13 (2020) packs 256GB of SSD storage.
                Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth and it comes with Headphone and Mic
                Combo Jack ports.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small text-small-sc">But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by
                AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load
                of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to
                what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.
